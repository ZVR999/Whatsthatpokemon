# Whatsthatpokemon
An assignment with pokemon using jQuery and AJAX for practice/fun

Simply click on any of the pictures of the pokemon on the left hand side and the pokedex with display cool information on the right 
hand side.

This was a very fun assignment where I had the chance to make a simple pokedex using the poke APi. Working within the json and bringing
out the correct information I needed to display using .get(). All of this was great practice and I will be coming back after graduating
to add some more CSS and whatever else I learn to make this more my own.
